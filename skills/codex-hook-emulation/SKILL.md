# Codex Hook Emulation

Emulate the **highest-value parts of Claude Code hooks** inside Codex using:
- `AGENTS.md` protocol rules,
- a deterministic helper script,
- and explicit agent behavior at session boundaries and risky actions.

## What this skill does

This skill maps Claude Code hook intent onto Codex-native substitutes:
- `SessionStart` -> deterministic session-start summary
- `PreToolUse` -> dangerous-action preflight guard
- `PostToolUse` -> post-edit verification suggestions
- `Stop` / `SessionEnd` -> deterministic closeout summary + `session-wrap-up`

When the current repo is bound to Obsidian project memory, the helper should also surface the same kind of **Obsidian-aware reminders** that the main-branch hooks provide:
- binding status,
- project id / vault root / auto-sync,
- minimum post-turn maintenance reminders,
- bootstrap hints for research-repo candidates that are still unbound.

## What it does not do

- It does **not** create true native Codex hooks.
- It does **not** intercept every tool automatically at runtime.
- It does **not** replace sandboxing or explicit user confirmation for destructive actions.

## Default workflow

### 1. Session start surrogate

At the start of a substantive repo session, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/codex_hook_emulation.py session-start --cwd "$PWD"
```

Use this as the Codex substitute for `SessionStart`.

### 2. Preflight guard for risky actions

Before destructive or irreversible operations, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/codex_hook_emulation.py preflight "git push --force origin main"
```

Interpret the result like this:
- exit `0` -> allow
- exit `3` -> ask / confirm first
- exit `2` -> block unless the user explicitly overrides with clear intent

### 3. Post-edit verification surrogate

After meaningful file edits, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/codex_hook_emulation.py post-edit --cwd "$PWD"
```

Or pass touched files explicitly:

```bash
python3 scripts/codex_hook_emulation.py post-edit --cwd "$PWD" README.md scripts/setup.sh
```

Use this as the Codex substitute for `PostToolUse`.

### 4. Session-end surrogate

Before closeout or when the user says `wrap up`, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/codex_hook_emulation.py session-end --cwd "$PWD"
```

Then apply `session-wrap-up` for the final human-readable summary.

## Behavioral rules

- Prefer this skill in Codex whenever you would normally rely on Claude Code hooks for workflow discipline.
- Use `preflight` before `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, dangerous deletes, risky chmods, or sensitive config writes.
- Use `post-edit` after code, skill, config, or Obsidian workflow changes.
- In bound research repos, treat the post-edit result as a reminder to consider minimum Obsidian write-back.
