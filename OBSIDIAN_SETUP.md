# Obsidian Project Knowledge Base Setup

Claude Scholar ships with a built-in Obsidian research knowledge-base workflow. It does **not** require MCP or an API key.

## What this provides

Obsidian is treated as the default knowledge base for a research project, not just a paper library. A project knowledge base can store:

- stable project background and research questions
- paper notes and literature syntheses
- experiment runbooks and result summaries
- daily research logs, scratch notes, and sync queues
- writing assets such as drafts, slides, proposals, and rebuttal material
- archived project knowledge that should not stay on the main working surface

## Requirements

### Required
- A local Obsidian vault path
- `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` set in your environment, or passed explicitly when bootstrapping a project

### Optional
- Obsidian Desktop installed and open for navigation
- `obsidian` CLI available for open/search/daily actions
- `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_NAME` for cleaner `obsidian://` links and CLI targeting

## Built-in skills

Claude Scholar includes official Obsidian-oriented skills plus project-focused wrappers.

Most relevant for the default workflow:

- `obsidian-project-memory`
- `obsidian-project-bootstrap`
- `obsidian-research-log`
- `obsidian-experiment-log`
- `obsidian-literature-workflow`
- `obsidian-project-lifecycle`
- `obsidian-markdown`
- `obsidian-cli`
- `defuddle`

Some optional graph-oriented helpers may still exist in the repo, but the default workflow does **not** depend on `.base`, MCP, or API services. The main default graph artifact is `Maps/literature.canvas`; additional `.base` views or project/experiment canvases are explicit-only.

## Default behavior

When Claude Scholar is running inside a repository that contains `.codex/project-memory/registry.yaml`, it should treat the repository as bound to an Obsidian project knowledge base and update it by default.

If the repository is not yet bound, but it looks like a research project (for example it contains `.git`, `README.md`, `docs/`, `notes/`, `plan/`, `results/`, `outputs/`, `src/`, or `scripts/`), Claude Scholar should bootstrap a project knowledge base automatically.

## Project structure in the vault

```text
Research/{project-slug}/
  00-Hub.md
  01-Plan.md
  Knowledge/
  Papers/
  Experiments/
  Results/
  Writing/
  Daily/
  Archive/
```

Key generated files commonly include:

- `Knowledge/Source-Inventory.md`
- `Knowledge/Codebase-Overview.md`
- `Maps/literature.canvas`
- `.codex/project-memory/<project_id>.md`

## Repository-local memory binding

Each research repo gets a local binding under:

```text
.codex/project-memory/
  registry.yaml
  <project_id>.md
```

- `registry.yaml` stores the repo ↔ vault binding
- `<project_id>.md` stores the assistant-facing project memory for incremental syncs

## Main workflows

Codex does not expose slash commands the way Claude Code does. In the Codex edition, use the same workflows through natural-language prompts plus the corresponding skills/agents:

- initialize or import a project knowledge base
- ingest a new Markdown file or directory via classify -> promote / merge / stage-to-daily
- force deterministic filesystem sync and refresh helper notes
- repair or strengthen wikilinks across canonical notes
- generate literature synthesis from project notes
- normalize paper notes and connect them to project context
- archive / purge / rename a single canonical note
- detach / archive / purge / rebuild a project knowledge base
- explicitly generate optional `.base` views and extra canvases

## Minimum bound-repo maintenance

When a repo is already bound through `.codex/project-memory/registry.yaml`, Claude Scholar should keep automatic maintenance conservative:

- always verify `Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` when the turn changes research state,
- update `00-Hub.md` only when top-level project status actually changes,
- update `.codex/project-memory/<project_id>.md` whenever project state changes,
- keep `Knowledge/`, `Experiments/`, `Results/`, and `Writing/` agent-first rather than automatically rewriting them every turn.

## Optional Obsidian CLI installation

The official Obsidian CLI is built into newer desktop installers. To use `obsidian ...` commands:

1. Use an Obsidian desktop build that supports CLI registration.
2. In Obsidian Desktop, open `Settings -> General -> Advanced`.
3. Turn on **Command line interface**.
4. Ensure `/Applications/Obsidian.app/Contents/MacOS` is on your `PATH` on macOS (for example via `~/.zprofile`).
5. Restart your terminal, then verify:

```bash
obsidian help
obsidian search query="diffusion" limit=5
```

If you see `Command line interface is not enabled`, the shell path is fine but the Obsidian in-app toggle is still off.

## Lifecycle actions

### Detach
- stop automatic syncing
- keep vault content
- keep project memory file

### Archive (default for “remove this project’s knowledge”)
- move the project under `Archive/`
- disable syncing
- keep project memory for future reactivation

### Purge
- permanently delete the binding, project memory, and vault project folder
- only use when the user explicitly asks for permanent deletion

## Optional CLI and URI usage

Claude Scholar can optionally use the official Obsidian CLI and URI scheme:

- CLI docs: <https://help.obsidian.md/cli>
- URI docs: <https://help.obsidian.md/uri>

Examples:

```bash
obsidian help
obsidian search query="diffusion" limit=10
obsidian daily:append content="- [ ] Follow up on experiment"
```

```text
obsidian://open?vault=My%20Vault&file=Research%2Fproject-slug%2F00-Hub
obsidian://search?vault=My%20Vault&query=%23experiment
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Bootstrap fails with missing vault path | Set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` or pass a vault path explicitly |
| Project keeps re-importing | Check `.codex/project-memory/registry.yaml` exists and points to the correct repo root |
| The vault still shows `Views/`, `Concepts/`, or `Datasets/` as defaults | Those are from older docs or older project generations; the current default workflow uses the compact structure above and only keeps `Maps/literature.canvas` by default |
| CLI commands fail | Check that `Settings -> General -> Advanced -> Command line interface` is enabled; otherwise continue with filesystem-only sync |
| “Remove project knowledge” is too destructive | Use archive or detach; purge is only for permanent deletion |
