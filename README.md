## Recent News

- **2026-03-31**: **Zotero smart-import workflow docs aligned** — updated Claude Scholar's research-facing docs around the latest `zotero-mcp` public surface: `zotero_add_items_by_identifier` is now the default paper-import path, `zotero_reconcile_collection_duplicates` is the standard post-import cleanup step, source-aware PDF cascade behavior is documented more accurately, and public vs internal diagnostics are now clearly separated.
- **2026-03-31**: **README onboarding refreshed** — clarified that Claude Scholar is especially well-suited to computer science and AI researchers, added practical getting-started scenarios after installation, improved prerequisite and branch guidance, and made the “existing local md files must be manually merged” expectation much more explicit.
- **2026-03-31**: **Installer and hook behavior tightened** — the installer now preserves existing local `CLAUDE.md` / `CLAUDE.zh-CN.md` files while installing repo-managed sidecar copies, and the default hook summaries were trimmed to reduce noisy temp-file / uncommitted-file output while keeping safer write-guard behavior.
- **2026-03-31**: **Japanese documentation added** — added Japanese docs for the main README plus `CLAUDE`, `MCP_SETUP`, and `OBSIDIAN_SETUP`, so the repository now has a more complete multilingual documentation surface.

## Why Claude Scholar

Claude Scholar is **not** an end-to-end autonomous research system that tries to replace the researcher.

Its core idea is simple:

> **human decision-making stays at the center; the assistant accelerates the workflow around it.**

That means Claude Scholar is designed to help with the heavy, repetitive, and structure-sensitive parts of research — literature organization, note-taking, experiment analysis, reporting, and writing support — while still keeping the key judgments in human hands:

- which problem is worth pursuing,
- which papers actually matter,
- which hypotheses are worth testing,
- which results are convincing,
- and what should be written, submitted, or abandoned.

In other words, Claude Scholar is a **semi-automated research assistant**, not a “fully automated scientist.”

## Who This Is For

Claude Scholar is especially well-suited to:

- **computer science researchers** who move between literature review, coding, experiments, and paper writing,
- **AI / ML researchers** who need one assistant workflow spanning ideation, implementation, analysis, reporting, and rebuttal,
- **research engineers and graduate students** who want stronger workflow structure without giving up human judgment,
- and **software-heavy academic projects** that benefit from Zotero, Obsidian, CLI automation, and reproducible project memory.

It can still help in other research settings, but its current workflow design is most aligned with computer science, AI, and adjacent computational research.

## Core Workflow

- **Ideation**: turn a vague topic into concrete questions, research gaps, and an initial plan.
- **Literature**: search, import, organize, and read papers through Zotero collections.
- **Paper notes**: convert papers into structured reading notes and reusable claims.
- **Knowledge base**: route durable knowledge into Obsidian across `Papers / Knowledge / Experiments / Results / Writing`, with round-level experiment reports stored under `Results/Reports/`.
- **Experiments**: track hypotheses, experiment lines, run history, findings, and next actions.
- **Analysis**: generate strict statistics, real scientific figures, and analysis artifacts with `results-analysis`.
- **Reporting**: produce a complete post-experiment report with `results-report`, then write it back into Obsidian.
- **Writing and publication**: carry stable findings into literature reviews, papers, rebuttals, slides, posters, and promotion.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
- Git
- (Optional) Python + [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python development
- (Optional) [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) + [Galaxy-Dawn/zotero-mcp](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/zotero-mcp) for literature workflows
- (Optional) [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for project knowledge-base workflows

### Option 1: Full Installation (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
bash /tmp/claude-scholar/scripts/setup.sh
```

**Windows**: please use Git Bash or WSL to run the installer.

The installer is **backup-aware and incremental-update friendly**:
- updates repo-managed `skills/commands/agents/rules/hooks/scripts/CLAUDE*.md`,
- backs up overwritten files to `~/.claude/.claude-scholar-backups/<timestamp>/`,
- backs up `settings.json` to `settings.json.bak`,
- preserves an existing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and installs the repo-managed version as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.scholar.md`,
- preserves an existing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.md` and installs the repo-managed version as `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.scholar.md`,
- preserves your existing `env`, model/provider settings, API keys, permissions, and current `mcpServers` values,
- adds missing hook entries instead of replacing your entire hook set.

**Important CLAUDE note**: if you already maintain your own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.md`, review `~/.claude/CLAUDE.scholar.md` and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.scholar.md` after installation and manually merge the Claude Scholar sections you want into your own files. Do not assume the sidecar files are applied automatically.

To update later:

```bash
cd /tmp/claude-scholar
git pull --ff-only
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

### Option 2: Minimal Installation

Install only a small research-focused subset:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks ~/.claude/skills
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/hooks/*.js ~/.claude/hooks/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/ml-paper-writing ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/research-ideation ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/results-analysis ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/results-report ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/review-response ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/writing-anti-ai ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/git-workflow ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/bug-detective ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Post-install**: minimal/manual install does **not** auto-merge `settings.json`; copy only the hooks or MCP entries you want from `settings.json.template`. If you already have your own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.md`, also merge the relevant sections from this repo's Claude files into yours instead of blindly overwriting them.

### Option 3: Selective Installation

Copy only the parts you need:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
cd /tmp/claude-scholar

cp hooks/*.js ~/.claude/hooks/
cp -r skills/latex-conference-template-organizer ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/architecture-design ~/.claude/skills/
cp agents/paper-miner.md ~/.claude/agents/
cp rules/coding-style.md ~/.claude/rules/
cp rules/agents.md ~/.claude/rules/
```

**Post-install**: selective/manual install does **not** auto-merge `settings.json`; copy only the hooks or MCP entries you actually want from `settings.json.template`. If you already have your own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.md`, merge the relevant sections from this repo's Claude files into yours instead of blindly overwriting them.

### Option 4: Plugin Marketplace Installation

**Step 1: Install the Plugin**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar
/plugin install claude-scholar@claude-scholar
```

This auto-loads all skills, commands, agents, and hooks. During installation, you can choose the scope: user (all projects) or project (single project).

**Step 2: Install Rules (Required)**

Claude Code plugins cannot distribute rules automatically. Install them manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar

# User-level (all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/rules
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/rules/*.md ~/.claude/rules/

# Or project-level (current project only)
mkdir -p .claude/rules
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/rules/*.md .claude/rules/
```

**Post-install**: plugin installation does **not** auto-load `CLAUDE.md` or configure `settings.json`; if you already have your own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.zh-CN.md`, merge the relevant Claude Scholar sections into yours instead of assuming the plugin applies them automatically. If you need Zotero MCP or other integrations, see the [Integrations](#integrations) section for manual setup.

## Getting Started Scenarios

After installation, the simplest way to begin is to describe your task in natural language. You do not need to memorize the whole system first. Below are a few realistic starting points.

### 1. Start a New Research Topic
**You can say:**
> Help me start research on [your topic]. I want a literature-grounded plan, the key open questions, and the next concrete steps.

**What Claude Scholar will typically help with:**
- clarify the topic and narrow the research question,
- identify promising literature directions,
- suggest an initial plan or hypothesis list,
- optionally route the work into Zotero or Obsidian if you use them.

### 2. Review a Zotero Collection
**You can say:**
> Review my Zotero collection on brain foundation models and summarize the main directions, gaps, and promising next steps.

**Typical output:**
- paper grouping by theme,
- a short literature synthesis,
- gap analysis,
- candidate research directions worth pursuing next.

### 3. Analyze Finished Experiment Results
**You can say:**
> Analyze the results in this experiment folder, check what changed across runs, and write a decision-oriented summary.

**Typical output:**
- metric comparison,
- ablation or error-analysis suggestions,
- a result summary that highlights what is solid, what is weak, and what to run next.

### 4. Draft a Paper or Rebuttal Section
**You can say:**
> Help me draft the related work section for this project based on the current findings and paper notes.

or:

> Help me write a rebuttal draft for these reviewer comments.

**Typical output:**
- a structured section draft,
- improved argument flow,
- clearer claims and evidence mapping,
- follow-up points that still need support or verification.

### Practical Notes
- Start with one concrete task, not a vague request for "everything."
- If you already maintain your own local `CLAUDE.md` files, merge the Claude Scholar sections you want into them instead of assuming sidecar files apply automatically.
- Zotero and Obsidian are optional, but they become much more useful when you want durable literature notes or project memory rather than one-off chat output.

## Platform Support

Claude Scholar is maintained for:

- **Claude Code** — the primary installation target.
- **Codex CLI** — supported workflow and documentation are available in this repo ecosystem.
- **OpenCode** — supported as an alternative CLI workflow.

The top-level workflow is the same: research, coding, experiments, reporting, and project knowledge management.

## Integrations

### Zotero

Use Zotero when you want Claude Scholar to help with:
- paper import via DOI / arXiv / URL,
- collection-based reading workflows,
- full-text access through Zotero MCP,
- detailed paper notes and literature synthesis.

See [MCP_SETUP.md](./MCP_SETUP.md).

### Obsidian

Use Obsidian when you want Claude Scholar to maintain a filesystem-first research knowledge base:
- `Papers/`
- `Experiments/`
- `Results/`
- `Results/Reports/`
- `Writing/`
- `Daily/`

See [OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md](./OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md).

## Primary Workflows

Complete academic research lifecycle — 7 stages from idea to publication.

### 1. Research Ideation (Zotero-Integrated)

End-to-end research startup from idea generation to literature management.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `research-ideation` | Turn vague topics into structured questions, gap analysis, and an initial research plan. |
| Agent | `literature-reviewer` | Search, classify, and synthesize papers into an actionable literature picture. |
| Command | `/research-init` | Start a new topic from literature search to Zotero organization and proposal drafting. |
| Command | `/zotero-review` | Review an existing Zotero collection and generate a structured literature synthesis. |
| Command | `/zotero-notes` | Batch-read a Zotero collection and create structured paper reading notes. |

**How it works**
- **5W1H Brainstorming**: turn a vague topic into structured questions (`What / Why / Who / When / Where / How`).
- **Literature Search & Import**: search papers, extract DOI/arXiv/URLs, import them into Zotero, and organize them into themed collections.
- **PDF & Full Text**: attach PDFs when available, read full text when possible, and fall back to abstract-level analysis when necessary.
- **Gap Analysis**: identify literature, methodological, application, interdisciplinary, or temporal gaps.
- **Research Question & Planning**: convert the review into concrete questions, initial hypotheses, and next-step planning.

**Typical output**
- literature review notes
- structured Zotero collection
- project proposal / research direction draft

### 2. ML Project Development

Maintainable ML project structure for experiment code and iteration.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `architecture-design` | Define maintainable ML project structure when new registrable components or modules are introduced. |
| Skill | `git-workflow` | Enforce branch hygiene, commit conventions, and safer collaboration workflows. |
| Skill | `bug-detective` | Debug stack traces, shell failures, and code-path issues systematically. |
| Agent | `code-reviewer` | Review modified code for correctness, maintainability, and implementation quality. |
| Agent | `dev-planner` | Break complex engineering work into concrete implementation steps. |

- **Git Discipline**: use branch hygiene, conventional commits, and safer merge/rebase workflows.

### 3. Experiment Analysis

Strict analysis of experimental results with scientific figures and report-ready artifacts.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `results-analysis` | Produce a strict analysis bundle with rigorous statistics, real scientific figures, and analysis artifacts. |
| Skill | `results-report` | Turn analysis artifacts into a complete post-experiment report with decisions, limitations, and next actions. |
| Command | `/analyze-results` | Run the full experiment workflow in one shot: strict analysis first, then final report generation. |

**How it works**
- **Data Processing**: read experiment logs, metrics files, and result directories.
- **Statistical Testing**: run strict statistical checks such as t-test / ANOVA / Wilcoxon where appropriate.
- **Visualization**: generate real scientific figures with interpretation guidance, not just vague plotting suggestions.
- **Ablation & Comparison**: analyze component contribution, performance tradeoffs, and stability.
- **Post-Experiment Reporting**: turn the analysis bundle into a full retrospective report with conclusions, limitations, and next actions.

**Typical output**

|---|---|---|
| Skill | `ml-paper-writing` | Draft publication-oriented ML/AI papers from repo context, evidence, and literature. |
| Skill | `citation-verification` | Check references, metadata, and claim-citation alignment to prevent citation mistakes. |
| Skill | `writing-anti-ai` | Reduce robotic phrasing and improve clarity, rhythm, and human academic tone. |
| Skill | `latex-conference-template-organizer` | Clean messy conference templates into an Overleaf-ready writing structure. |
| Agent | `paper-miner` | Mine strong papers for reusable writing patterns, structure, and venue expectations. |
| Command | `/mine-writing-patterns` | Read a paper and merge reusable writing knowledge into the global paper-miner writing memory. |

**How it works**
- **Template Preparation**: clean conference templates into an Overleaf-ready structure.
- **Citation Verification**: verify references, metadata, and claim-citation alignment.
- **Systematic Writing**: draft sections from repo context, experiment evidence, and literature notes.
- **Style Refinement**: reduce robotic phrasing and improve rhythm, clarity, and tone.

### 5. Paper Self-Review

Quality assurance before submission.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|

- **Logic Validation**: claim-evidence alignment, assumption clarity, and argument consistency.
- **Citation Audit**: reference correctness and completeness.
- **Figure Quality**: caption completeness, readability, and accessibility.
- **Compliance**: page limits, formatting, and disclosure requirements.

### 6. Submission & Rebuttal

Submission preparation and review response workflow.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `review-response` | Structure reviewer comments into an evidence-based rebuttal workflow. |
| Agent | `rebuttal-writer` | Draft professional, respectful, and strategically organized rebuttal text. |
| Command | `/rebuttal` | Generate a complete rebuttal draft from review comments and evidence. |

**How it works**
- **Pre-submission Checks**: venue-specific formatting, anonymization, and checklist requirements.

| Command | `/poster` | Organize the work into poster-ready content and layout guidance. |
| Command | `/promote` | Draft public-facing promotion content such as summaries, posts, or threads. |

**How it works**
- **Presentation**: prepare talk structure and slide guidance.
- **Poster**: organize content into poster-ready layout and hierarchy.
- **Promotion**: generate social media, blog, or summary material for broader communication.

## Supporting Workflows

These workflows run in the background to strengthen the primary workflows.

### Obsidian Project Knowledge Base

Use Obsidian as the durable sink for project knowledge, not just as a note dump.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `obsidian-project-memory` | Maintain the project-level Obsidian knowledge base and decide what durable knowledge should be written back. |
| Skill | `obsidian-project-bootstrap` | Initialize an Obsidian knowledge base for a new or existing research project. |
| Skill | `obsidian-research-log` | Record daily research progress, plans, ideas, and TODOs into the knowledge base. |
| Skill | `obsidian-experiment-log` | Capture experiment setup, run history, outcomes, and follow-up actions in Obsidian. |
| Command | `/obsidian-ingest` | Ingest a new Markdown file or folder into the correct place in the knowledge base. |
| Command | `/obsidian-note` | Manage a single note lifecycle such as lookup, rename, archive, or purge. |
| Command | `/obsidian-views` | Generate or refresh optional Obsidian views such as `.base` files. |

**How it works**
- bind an existing repo to an Obsidian vault,
- route stable knowledge into `Papers / Knowledge / Experiments / Results / Writing`, with round-level experiment reports stored under `Results/Reports/`,
- keep `Daily/` and project memory updated conservatively,
- ingest new Markdown files into the correct canonical destination,
- optionally generate extra views and canvases.

**Note language configuration**

Generated and synced Obsidian notes resolve their language with this priority:
1. project config: `.claude/project-memory/registry.yaml` -> `note_language`
2. environment variable: `OBSIDIAN_NOTE_LANGUAGE`
3. default: `en`

Note: the file is currently named `registry.yaml` for historical reasons, but its on-disk format is JSON.

Per-project example:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "my-project": {
      "project_id": "my-project",
      "vault_root": "/path/to/vault/Research/my-project",
      "note_language": "zh-CN"
    }
  }
}
```

English and Chinese section headings remain mutually compatible during sync, so older notes in either language can still be updated safely after switching configuration.

### Automated Enforcement Workflow

Cross-platform hooks automate routine workflow checks and reminders.

**Hooks**
- `skill-forced-eval.js`
- `session-start.js`
- `session-summary.js`
- `stop-summary.js`
- `security-guard.js`

**How it works**
- **Before prompts**: evaluate applicable skills and surface relevant workflow hints.
- **At session start**: show Git state, available commands, and project-memory context.
- **At session end/stop**: summarize work and remind the user about minimum maintenance tasks.
- **Security**: block catastrophic commands and require confirmation for dangerous but legitimate ones.

### Knowledge Extraction Workflow

Specialized agents can mine reusable knowledge from papers and competitions.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Agent | `paper-miner` | Extract reusable writing knowledge, structure patterns, and venue heuristics from strong papers. |
| Agent | `kaggle-miner` | Extract engineering practices and solution patterns from strong Kaggle workflows. |

**How it works**
- extract writing patterns, venue expectations, and rebuttal strategies from papers,
- extract engineering patterns and solution structure from Kaggle workflows,
- feed those insights back into skills and reference material.

### Skill Evolution System

Claude Scholar also contains a self-improvement loop for its own skills.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `skill-development` | Create new skills with clear triggers, structure, and progressive disclosure. |
| Skill | `skill-quality-reviewer` | Review skills across content quality, organization, style, and structural integrity. |
| Skill | `skill-improver` | Apply structured improvement plans to evolve existing skills. |

**How it works**
- create new skills with clear trigger descriptions,
- review them across quality dimensions,
- apply structured improvements and iterate.
