> Semi-automated research assistant for academic research and software development, especially for computer science and AI researchers, adapted for [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) across ideation, literature review, experiments, reporting, writing, and project knowledge management.
>
> **Branch note**: this is the **Codex CLI edition** of Claude Scholar. For the Claude Code version, see the [`main` branch](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar/tree/main). For the OpenCode version, see the [`opencode` branch](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar/tree/opencode).

## Recent News

- **2026-04-15**: **pubfig and pubtab introduced** — introduced [`pubfig`](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/pubfig), a Python package for publication-grade scientific figures, and [`pubtab`](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/pubtab), a Python package for publication-ready tables and Excel↔LaTeX workflows. Together they provide a cleaner production stack for paper figures, benchmark tables, export control, and final artifact QA.
- **2026-04-15**: **publication-chart-skill integrated into Claude Scholar** — wrapped [`pubfig`](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/pubfig) + [`pubtab`](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/pubtab) into `publication-chart-skill`, added the skill to the repository, and connected it to Claude Scholar's analysis and writing boundaries so publication-grade figure/table work now has an explicit handoff route instead of being mixed into general analysis or prose skills.

## Why Claude Scholar

Claude Scholar is **not** an end-to-end autonomous research system that tries to replace the researcher.

Its core idea is simple:

> **human decision-making stays at the center; the assistant accelerates the workflow around it.**

That means the Codex edition is designed to help with the heavy, repetitive, and structure-sensitive parts of research — literature organization, note-taking, experiment analysis, reporting, and writing support — while still keeping the key judgments in human hands:

- which problem is worth pursuing,
- which papers actually matter,
- which hypotheses are worth testing,
- which results are convincing,
- and what should be written, submitted, or abandoned.

In other words, Claude Scholar is a **semi-automated research assistant**, not a fully automated scientist.

## Who This Is For

Claude Scholar is especially well-suited to:

- **computer science researchers** who move between literature review, coding, experiments, and paper writing,
- **AI / ML researchers** who need one assistant workflow spanning ideation, implementation, analysis, reporting, and rebuttal,
- **research engineers and graduate students** who want stronger workflow structure without giving up human judgment,
- and **software-heavy academic projects** that benefit from Zotero, Obsidian, CLI automation, and reproducible project memory.

It can still help in other research settings, but its current workflow design is most aligned with computer science, AI, and adjacent computational research.

## Core Workflow

- **Ideation**: turn a vague topic into concrete questions, research gaps, and an initial plan.
- **Literature**: search, import, organize, and read papers through Zotero collections.
- **Paper notes**: convert papers into structured reading notes and reusable claims.
- **Knowledge base**: route durable knowledge into Obsidian across `Papers / Knowledge / Experiments / Results / Writing`, with round-level experiment reports stored under `Results/Reports/`.
- **Experiments**: track hypotheses, experiment lines, run history, findings, and next actions.
- **Analysis**: generate strict statistics, real scientific figures, and analysis artifacts with `results-analysis`.
- **Reporting**: produce a complete post-experiment report with `results-report`, then write it back into Obsidian.
- **Writing and publication**: carry stable findings into literature reviews, papers, rebuttals, slides, posters, and promotion.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)
- Git
- (Optional) Python + [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python development
- (Optional) [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) + [Galaxy-Dawn/zotero-mcp](https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/zotero-mcp) for literature workflows
- (Optional) [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for project knowledge-base workflows

### Option 1: Full Installation (Recommended)

```bash
git clone -b codex https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
bash /tmp/claude-scholar/scripts/setup.sh
```

The installer is **backup-aware and incremental-update friendly**:
- syncs repo-managed `skills/`, `agents/`, `scripts/`, and `utils/`,
- merges Claude Scholar sections into an existing `~/.codex/config.toml` when you keep your current provider/model,
- backs up `config.toml` and `auth.json` before overwriting,
- preserves an existing `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and installs the repo-managed version as `~/.codex/AGENTS.scholar.md`,
- preserves your existing provider/model/API key when you choose the incremental-update path,
- optionally enables the Zotero MCP block already present in the template config.

**Important AGENTS note**: if you already maintain your own `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, review `~/.codex/AGENTS.scholar.md` after installation and manually merge the Claude Scholar sections you want into your own `AGENTS.md`. Do not assume the sidecar file is applied automatically.

To update later:

```bash
cd /tmp/claude-scholar
git pull --ff-only
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

**Windows**: please use Git Bash or WSL to run the installer.

### Option 2: Minimal Installation

Install only a small research-focused subset:

```bash
git clone -b codex https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills ~/.codex/agents
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/research-ideation ~/.codex/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/results-analysis ~/.codex/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/results-report ~/.codex/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/ml-paper-writing ~/.codex/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/review-response ~/.codex/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/agents/literature-reviewer ~/.codex/agents/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/agents/paper-miner ~/.codex/agents/
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/AGENTS.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
```

**Post-install**: minimal/manual install does **not** auto-merge your `config.toml`; copy only the sections you need from the repository config and setup guides. If you already have your own `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, merge the relevant sections from this repo's `AGENTS.md` into your file instead of blindly overwriting it.

### Option 3: Selective Installation

Copy only the pieces you want:

```bash
git clone -b codex https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/claude-scholar.git /tmp/claude-scholar
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/skills/<skill-name> ~/.codex/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-scholar/agents/<agent-name> ~/.codex/agents/
cp /tmp/claude-scholar/AGENTS.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
```

**Post-install**: selective/manual install does **not** auto-merge your `config.toml`, and if you already have your own `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, merge the relevant sections from this repo's `AGENTS.md` into your file instead of blindly overwriting it.

**Important Codex note**:
- Codex does **not** show custom skills in `/...` menus.
- Use natural language prompts, or explicitly invoke a skill as `$skill-name` when needed.

## Getting Started Scenarios

After installation, the simplest way to begin is to describe your task in natural language. You do not need to memorize the whole system first, and Codex does not require slash-menu discovery for these workflows. Below are a few realistic starting points.

### 1. Start a New Research Topic
**You can say:**
> Help me start research on [your topic]. I want a literature-grounded plan, the key open questions, and the next concrete steps.

**What Claude Scholar will typically help with:**
- clarify the topic and narrow the research question,
- identify promising literature directions,
- suggest an initial plan or hypothesis list,
- optionally route the work into Zotero or Obsidian if you use them.

### 2. Review a Zotero Collection
**You can say:**
> Review my Zotero collection on brain foundation models and summarize the main directions, gaps, and promising next steps.

**Typical output:**
- paper grouping by theme,
- a short literature synthesis,
- gap analysis,
- candidate research directions worth pursuing next.

### 3. Analyze Finished Experiment Results
**You can say:**
> Analyze the results in this experiment folder, check what changed across runs, and write a decision-oriented summary.

**Typical output:**
- metric comparison,
- ablation or error-analysis suggestions,
- a result summary that highlights what is solid, what is weak, and what to run next.

### 4. Draft a Paper or Rebuttal Section
**You can say:**
> Help me draft the related work section for this project based on the current findings and paper notes.

or:

> Help me write a rebuttal draft for these reviewer comments.

**Typical output:**
- a structured section draft,
- improved argument flow,
- clearer claims and evidence mapping,
- follow-up points that still need support or verification.

### Practical Notes
- Start with one concrete task, not a vague request for "everything."
- In Codex, natural-language prompts are the default entrypoint; use `$skill-name` only when you want to force a specific skill.
- If you already maintain your own local `AGENTS.md`, merge the Claude Scholar sections you want from `AGENTS.scholar.md` instead of assuming sidecar files apply automatically.
- Zotero and Obsidian are optional, but they become much more useful when you want durable literature notes or project memory rather than one-off chat output.

## Platform Scope

This branch targets **Codex CLI**.

- **Codex CLI (`codex` branch)** — TOML config, AGENTS-based discipline, filesystem-first Obsidian workflow, and Codex-native installation docs
- **Claude Code (`main` branch)** — Claude Code setup, native hooks, and the main cross-platform documentation line
- **OpenCode (`opencode` branch)** — OpenCode-specific configuration and installation path

The research workflow is intentionally similar across branches, but the operational surface differs by platform.

## Integrations

### Zotero

Use Zotero when you want Claude Scholar to help with:
- paper import via DOI / arXiv / URL,
- collection-based reading workflows,
- full-text access through Zotero MCP,
- detailed paper notes and literature synthesis.

See [MCP_SETUP.md](./MCP_SETUP.md).

### Obsidian

Use Obsidian when you want Claude Scholar to maintain a filesystem-first research knowledge base:
- `Papers/`
- `Knowledge/`
- `Experiments/`
- `Results/`
- `Results/Reports/`
- `Writing/`
- `Daily/`

See [OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md](./OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md).

## Primary Workflows

Complete academic research lifecycle — 7 stages from idea to publication.

> **Codex entrypoint note**: this branch does not rely on repo slash commands. The normal entrypoint is natural language plus explicit skill invocation such as `$results-analysis` when needed.

### 1. Research Ideation (Zotero-Integrated)

Turn a vague topic into a structured research direction with literature support.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `research-ideation` | Turns a vague topic into structured questions, gap analysis, and an initial research plan. |
| Agent | `literature-reviewer` | Searches, classifies, and synthesizes papers into an actionable literature picture. |
| Skill | `zotero-obsidian-bridge` | Bridges Zotero collections into detailed paper notes and downstream Obsidian knowledge work. |

**How it works**
- **5W1H brainstorming**: turn vague interests into structured questions.
- **Literature search and import**: find papers, extract DOI/arXiv/URL, import them into Zotero, and organize them into themed collections.
- **PDF and full text**: attach PDFs when available and read full text when possible.
- **Gap analysis**: identify literature, methodological, application, interdisciplinary, and temporal gaps.
- **Research question and planning**: turn literature synthesis into concrete questions, first hypotheses, and next actions.

**Typical output**
- literature review notes
- structured Zotero collections
- research proposal or direction draft

### 2. ML Project Development

Maintainable ML project development for experiment code and repo hygiene.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `architecture-design` | Designs maintainable ML project structure when adding registrable components or new modules. |
| Skill | `git-workflow` | Enforces safer branching, commit discipline, and collaboration habits. |
| Skill | `bug-detective` | Systematically investigates stack traces, shell errors, and broken code paths. |
| Skill | `git-commit` | Creates Conventional Commit messages locally. |
| Skill | `git-push` | Stages, commits, and pushes using Conventional Commits. |
| Agent | `code-reviewer` | Reviews changed code for correctness, maintainability, and implementation quality. |
| Agent | `dev-planner` | Breaks complex engineering work into executable implementation steps. |

**How it works**
- **Structure**: use Factory / Registry patterns where they actually help.
- **Code quality**: keep files readable, typed, and config-driven.
- **Debugging**: treat shell failures, traces, and path issues systematically.
- **Git discipline**: keep a safer branch and commit workflow around fast iteration.

### 3. Experiment Analysis

Strict experiment analysis workflow: statistics, scientific figures, analysis artifacts, and post-experiment reporting.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `results-analysis` | Produces strict statistics, real scientific figures, and analysis appendices. |
| Skill | `results-report` | Converts analysis artifacts into a complete post-experiment report with conclusions, limitations, and next actions. |
| Agent | `research-knowledge-curator-obsidian` | Writes stable findings back into the Obsidian project knowledge base when the repo is bound. |

**How it works**
- **Data processing**: read experiment logs, metrics files, and result directories.
- **Statistical testing**: run strict tests under the right assumptions and report uncertainty clearly.
- **Visualization**: generate real scientific figures instead of vague plotting advice.
- **Ablation and comparison**: analyze component contribution, trade-offs, and stability.
- **Post-experiment reporting**: hand off to `results-report` for a complete retrospective tied to decisions.

**Typical output**
- `analysis-report.md`
- `stats-appendix.md`
- `figure-catalog.md`
- `figures/`
- an Obsidian write-back under `Results/Reports/`

### 4. Paper Writing

Systematic paper writing from template preparation to iterative drafting.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `ml-paper-writing` | Drafts submission-oriented ML/AI papers from repos, results, and literature context. |
| Skill | `citation-verification` | Checks references, metadata, and claim-citation alignment. |
| Skill | `writing-anti-ai` | Reduces formulaic phrasing and improves rhythm, clarity, and academic tone. |
| Skill | `latex-conference-template-organizer` | Cleans conference templates into Overleaf-ready writing structure. |
| Agent | `paper-miner` | Extracts reusable writing patterns, structure signals, and venue knowledge from strong papers. |

**How it works**
- **Template preparation**: clean messy conference templates into usable writing structure.
- **Citation verification**: check references, metadata, and claim support.
- **Systematic writing**: draft section-by-section from repo evidence and literature context.
- **Writing memory reuse**: mine and reuse durable writing patterns through `paper-miner` memory.

### 5. Paper Self-Review

Quality assurance before submission.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `paper-self-review` | Checks structure, logic, citations, figures, and compliance before submission. |

**How it works**
- **Structure check**: inspect logical flow, section balance, and narrative coherence.
- **Logic validation**: inspect claim-evidence alignment and assumption clarity.
- **Citation audit**: verify reference accuracy and completeness.
- **Figure quality**: inspect readability, captions, and accessibility.
- **Compliance**: inspect page limits, formatting, and disclosure requirements.

### 6. Submission and Rebuttal

Submission preparation and reviewer response workflow.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `review-response` | Organizes reviewer comments into an evidence-based rebuttal workflow. |
| Agent | `rebuttal-writer` | Drafts professional, respectful, and well-structured rebuttal text. |

**How it works**
- **Pre-submission checks**: verify venue formatting, anonymization, and required checklist items.
- **Review analysis**: classify reviewer comments into actionable issues.
- **Response strategy**: decide whether to accept, defend, clarify, or run new experiments.
- **Rebuttal writing**: produce structured, evidence-based responses with professional tone.

### 7. Post-Acceptance Processing

Conference preparation and research communication after acceptance.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `post-acceptance` | Supports slides, posters, and outward-facing communication after acceptance. |
| Agent | `ui-sketcher` | Helps structure visual materials such as slides, posters, and presentation flow when needed. |

**How it works**
- **Presentation**: prepare talk structure and slide guidance.
- **Poster**: structure poster content hierarchy and layout.
- **Promotion**: produce concise outward-facing summaries, threads, and post-acceptance materials.

## Supporting Workflows

These workflows run behind the primary workflows to strengthen the overall Codex experience.

### Obsidian Project Knowledge Base

Treat Obsidian as a durable research knowledge sink rather than a pile of disconnected notes.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `obsidian-project-memory` | Maintains the project-level Obsidian knowledge base and decides what stable knowledge should be written back. |
| Skill | `obsidian-project-bootstrap` | Initializes an Obsidian knowledge base for a new or existing research project. |
| Skill | `obsidian-research-log` | Writes daily research progress, plans, ideas, and TODOs into the knowledge base. |
| Skill | `obsidian-experiment-log` | Records experiment setup, run history, findings, and follow-up actions in Obsidian. |
| Skill | `obsidian-literature-workflow` | Handles filesystem-first paper-note normalization and literature synthesis inside Obsidian. |
| Skill | `zotero-obsidian-bridge` | Connects Zotero collections to canonical paper notes and literature maps in Obsidian. |

**How it works**
- bind an existing repo to an Obsidian vault,
- route stable knowledge into `Papers / Knowledge / Experiments / Results / Writing`, with round-level experiment reports stored under `Results/Reports/`,
- maintain `Daily/` and project memory conservatively,
- ingest new Markdown into the right canonical note,
- generate canvases or views only when the workflow actually calls for them.

**Note language configuration**

Generated and synced Obsidian notes now resolve their language with this priority:
1. project config: `.codex/project-memory/registry.yaml` -> `note_language`
2. environment variable: `OBSIDIAN_NOTE_LANGUAGE`
3. default: `en`

Note: the file is currently named `registry.yaml` for historical reasons, but its on-disk format is JSON.

Per-project example:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "my-project": {
      "project_id": "my-project",
      "vault_root": "/path/to/vault/Research/my-project",
      "note_language": "zh-CN"
    }
  }
}
```

English and Chinese section headings remain mutually compatible during sync, so older notes in either language can still be updated safely after switching configuration.

### Codex Session Discipline and Hook Emulation

Codex does not expose native Claude Code hooks, so this branch emulates the highest-value behaviors through AGENTS discipline and local helper scripts.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| File | `AGENTS.md` | Encodes session discipline, skill evaluation rules, safety rules, and Codex-specific workflow instructions. |
| Script | `scripts/codex_hook_emulation.py` | Emulates session-start, preflight, post-edit, and session-end behaviors inside repo workflows. |
| Skill | `session-wrap-up` | Produces work logs, cleanup reminders, and closeout summaries at the end of a session. |

**How it works**
- **Session start surrogate**: inspect repo state, skills, TODOs, and project context.
- **Preflight surrogate**: check dangerous or irreversible commands before execution.
- **Post-edit surrogate**: decide verification needs and minimum Obsidian write-back after meaningful edits.
- **Session end surrogate**: summarize work and remind follow-up maintenance actions.

### Knowledge Extraction Workflow

Specialized agents continuously mine reusable knowledge from papers and engineering solutions.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Agent | `paper-miner` | Extracts reusable writing patterns, structure signals, and response strategies from strong papers. |
| Agent | `kaggle-miner` | Extracts reusable engineering practices and solution patterns from strong Kaggle workflows. |

**How it works**
- mine writing patterns, venue expectations, and rebuttal strategies from papers,
- mine engineering patterns and solution structures from Kaggle workflows,
- feed that knowledge back into shared skills and references.

### Skill Evolution System

Claude Scholar also includes a self-improvement loop for its own skills.

| Type | Name | One-line explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `skill-development` | Creates new skills with clear triggers, structure, and progressive disclosure. |
| Skill | `skill-quality-reviewer` | Audits skills across content quality, organization, writing, and structural integrity. |
| Skill | `skill-improver` | Applies structured improvement plans to existing skills. |

**How it works**
- create new skills with clear trigger descriptions,
- review them across multiple quality dimensions,
- merge fixes and iterate over time.
